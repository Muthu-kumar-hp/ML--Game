## 📌 About
The ML Game is built using **Python** and leverages **machine learning** to predict and counter the player's moves in the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game.  
It’s a fun and interactive way to learn **ML model training, game logic, and Python scripting** all in one project! 🎯

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖥️ **Interactive Gameplay** – Play against an AI opponent.  
- 🤖 **AI Prediction** – The AI predicts your moves using a trained ML model.  
- 📈 **Training History** – Visualize model training progress with graphs.  
- 🛠️ **Modular Scripts** – Separate scripts for data collection, training, and gameplay.  
- ⚡ **Easy Setup** – Install dependencies via `requirements.txt`.  

---

## 💻 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muthu-kumar-hp/ML--Game.git
cd ML--Game
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
# Activate environment:
# Linux / Mac
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Collect Data (if you want to retrain the model):

python data_collection.py


Train the Model:

python model_training.py


Play the Game:

python main_game.py


⚠️ Note: You can skip data collection if you already have a pre-trained model.
